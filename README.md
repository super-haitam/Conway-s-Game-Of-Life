# Conway's Game Of Life

As you will know in the documentation in the project, The Game Of Life is a zero-player game, starting with a specific input, and following  the rules of the game, it will arrive to an output. Each cell of the 2d grid can either be dead or alive.

### Additional Features
Even though the game is supposed to be zero-player, although it's still kinda, I allowed the user to set the input, means that he can choose which cells are alive and which ones are dead.
Plus, you can _Start_ the game, _Stop_ it, _Clear_ it or _Reset_ it to the last time you clicked _Start_.
